### Inter-Rater Reliability

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

icc_res <- 
  calc_icc(
    ratings, 
    subject = "Second", 
    rater = "Rater", 
    score = "Rating",
    iter = 10000,
    file = "icc_akeelah",
    silent = 2
  )
```

A Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: subject variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). Subject variance was estimated at `r round(icc_res$summary$est[1], 2)`, 95\% ETI: [`r round(icc_res$summary$lower[1], 2)`, `r round(icc_res$summary$upper[1], 2)`]; rater variance was estimated at `r round(icc_res$summary$est[2], 2)` [`r round(icc_res$summary$lower[2], 2)`, `r round(icc_res$summary$upper[2], 2)`]; and residual variance was estimated at `r round(icc_res$summary$est[3], 2)`  [`r round(icc_res$summary$lower[3], 2)`, `r round(icc_res$summary$upper[3], 2)`]. See the figure below for the posterior distributions of each component.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 2
plot(icc_res, components = "var")
```


From these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k). Inter-rater reliability under this formulation was estimated as `r round(icc_res$summary$est[8], 3)`, 95% ETI: [`r round(icc_res$summary$lower[8], 3)`, `r round(icc_res$summary$upper[8], 3)`]. See the middle of the second row in the figure below for the posterior distribution of this formulation.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
plot(icc_res, components = "icc")
```
