These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.63 \n    0.43 \n    1.17 \n    0.38 \n  \n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    0.33 \n    0.28 \n    0.38 \n    0.20 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    0.68 \n    0.67 \n    0.70 \n    0.42 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings.

Smith’s son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner’s son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner’s nearly one-year struggle being homeless. The unusual spelling of the film’s title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended. The movie is set in San Francisco in 1981.> All information in this section came from Wikipedia."
