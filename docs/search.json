These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). Timepoint variance was estimated at 1.31, 95% ETI: [1.1, 1.73]; rater variance was estimated at 0.4 [0.28, 0.79]; and residual variance was estimated at 0.54 [0.52, 0.56]. See the figure below for the posterior distributions of each component.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k). Inter-rater reliability under this formulation was estimated as 0.989, 95% ETI: [0.985, 0.991]. See the middle of the second row in the figure below for the posterior distribution of this formulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively."
