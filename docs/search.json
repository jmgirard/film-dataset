Starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin, the film is set in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas. The film follows three main characters: Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), a Vietnam War veteran and welder who stumbles upon a large sum of money in the desert; Anton Chigurh (Bardem), a hitman who is tasked with recovering the money; and Ed Tom Bell (Jones), a local sheriff investigating the crime. The film also stars Kelly Macdonald as Moss’s wife Carla Jean, and Woody Harrelson as a bounty hunter seeking Moss and the return of the $2 million.\n\n\nAll information in this section came from Wikipedia."

    "text": "Film Information\n\n\nThe Parent Trap is a 1998 American romantic comedy film directed and co-written by Nancy Meyers, and produced and co-written by Charles Shyer. It is a remake of the 1961 film of the same name and an adaptation of Erich Kästner’s 1949 German novel Lisa and Lottie (Das doppelte Lottchen). Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters’ birth; Lindsay Lohan stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. David Swift wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on Lottie and Lisa. Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version.\n\n\nAll information in this section came from Wikipedia."

These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    0.613 \n    0.428 \n    1.177 \n    0.377 \n  \n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.329 \n    0.285 \n    0.378 \n    0.203 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    0.684 \n    0.668 \n    0.701 \n    0.421 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings.

    "text": "Film Information\n\n\nThe Pursuit of Happyness is a 2006 American biographical drama film directed by Gabriele Muccino and starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a homeless salesman. Smith’s son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner’s son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner’s nearly one-year struggle being homeless. The unusual spelling of the film’s title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended. The movie is set in San Francisco in 1981.\n\n\nAll information in this section came from Wikipedia."

The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    0.825 \n    0.571 \n    1.715 \n    0.335 \n  \n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.977 \n    0.845 \n    1.172 \n    0.397 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    0.662 \n    0.644 \n    0.683 \n    0.269 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Raters \n    Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    ICC(C,k) \n    0.978 \n    0.974 \n    0.981 \n    29 \n    Relative \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters. Values with higher posterior density are more probable."
