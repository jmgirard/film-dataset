    "text": "Film Information\n\n\nThe Pursuit of Happyness is a 2006 American biographical drama film directed by Gabriele Muccino and starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a homeless salesman. Smith’s son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner’s son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner’s nearly one-year struggle being homeless. The unusual spelling of the film’s title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended. The movie is set in San Francisco in 1981.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll information in this section came directly from Wikipedia."

    "text": "Holistic Ratings\nA total of 34 participants watched this film clip and then provided holistic ratings on how the entire clip made them feel. These holistic ratings were completed using five positive emotion scales (i.e., alert, determined, enthusiastic, excited, inspired) and five negative emotion scales (i.e., afraid, distressed, nervous, scared, upset), each rated on an ordinal scale from 0 to 4."

    "text": "Continuous Ratings\nA total of 32 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). Timepoint variance was estimated at 0.82, 95% ETI: [0.69, 1]; rater variance was estimated at 0.71 [0.49, 1.39]; and residual variance was estimated at 0.77 [0.75, 0.8]. See the figure below for the posterior distributions of each component.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k). Inter-rater reliability under this formulation was estimated as 0.972, 95% ETI: [0.966, 0.977]. See the middle of the second row in the figure below for the posterior distribution of this formulation."
