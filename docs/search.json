These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error).

    "text": "Continuous Ratings\nA total of 84 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\nEach clip was watched by participants who used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). The number of participants rating each clip ranged from 73 to 83 (Mdn=79, MAD=2.2). The table below provides the number of raters and duration per clip as well as a summary of the valence ratings distribution across raters (i.e., mean, standard deviation, and quartiles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbrev\nRaters\nMean\nSD\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\n\n\n\n\nAkeelahBee\n82\n1.52\n1.50\n-3.58\n0.20\n1.39\n2.70\n4.00\n\n\nBealeStreet\n78\n0.58\n1.32\n-4.00\n-0.18\n0.60\n1.42\n4.00\n\n\nCatchMe\n83\n0.30\n1.47\n-4.00\n-0.80\n0.40\n1.28\n4.00\n\n\nDaysSummer\n81\n0.20\n1.28\n-4.00\n-0.60\n0.01\n1.07\n3.60\n\n\nFences\n80\n-2.07\n1.48\n-4.00\n-3.24\n-2.20\n-1.06\n4.00\n\n\nForrestGump\n79\n-0.51\n1.69\n-4.00\n-1.71\n-0.80\n0.71\n4.00\n\n\nGoodWill\n78\n0.17\n1.57\n-4.00\n-0.76\n0.24\n1.20\n4.00\n\n\nGreenMile\n77\n-2.57\n1.50\n-4.00\n-3.87\n-3.01\n-1.80\n4.00\n\n\nKingsSpeech\n79\n0.48\n1.62\n-4.00\n-0.73\n0.51\n1.64\n4.00\n\n\nLadyBird\n73\n0.18\n1.33\n-4.00\n-0.80\n0.00\n1.01\n4.00\n\n\nLegallyBlonde\n78\n1.14\n1.51\n-4.00\n0.10\n1.15\n2.18\n4.00\n\n\nLittleMiss\n75\n-0.45\n1.44\n-4.00\n-1.38\n-0.52\n0.38\n4.00\n\n\nMarriageStory\n77\n-2.20\n1.59\n-4.00\n-3.48\n-2.48\n-1.26\n4.00\n\n\nMiracle\n79\n1.10\n1.55\n-4.00\n0.00\n0.93\n2.37\n4.00\n\n\nMoonlight\n80\n1.16\n1.20\n-3.03\n0.20\n1.04\n2.00\n4.00\n\n\nNoCountry\n75\n-1.00\n1.33\n-4.00\n-2.00\n-1.10\n-0.03\n4.00\n\n\nParentTrap\n80\n1.92\n1.37\n-4.00\n1.01\n2.08\n3.00\n4.00\n\n\nPulpFiction\n79\n0.20\n1.43\n-4.00\n-0.81\n0.00\n1.20\n4.00\n\n\nPursuitHappyness\n82\n1.36\n1.42\n-2.91\n0.31\n1.26\n2.40\n4.00\n\n\nSilenceLambs\n80\n-1.38\n1.39\n-4.00\n-2.40\n-1.31\n-0.45\n3.20\n\n\nSocialNetwork\n75\n-0.53\n1.69\n-4.00\n-1.70\n-0.62\n0.67\n4.00\n\n\nZodiac\n81\n-0.97\n1.56\n-4.00\n-2.14\n-0.82\n0.00\n4.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the estimated inter-rater reliability (i.e., balanced average-measures consistency intraclass correlation) for the continuous valence ratings of each clip.
