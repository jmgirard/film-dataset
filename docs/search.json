But like I said, \n  \n  \n    170.02 \n    172.227 \n    I went straight upstairs\nto take a shower. \n  \n  \n    173.50 \n    177.903 \n    And... when you came downstairs,\nwhat happened? \n  \n  \n    178.30 \n    181.543 \n    I saw Brooke standing over his body... \n  \n  \n    182.14 \n    184.142 \n    ...drenched in his blood. \n  \n  \n    189.78 \n    194.422 \n    - But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?\n- No, she'd stashed it by then. \n  \n  \n    194.58 \n    196.389 \n    Move to strike that\nfrom the record, Your Honor. \n  \n  \n    196.54 \n    198.542 \n    - It's speculation.\n- So stricken. \n  \n  \n    201.34 \n    202.341 \n    Go ahead. \n  \n  \n    207.62 \n    210.510 \n    Ms. Windham, did you hear a shot fired? \n  \n  \n    211.06 \n    212.983 \n    No. I was in the shower. \n  \n  \n    214.38 \n    215.461 \n    OK. \n  \n  \n    215.62 \n    219.227 \n    So... sometime in the 20 minutes \n  \n  \n    219.38 \n    221.064 \n    that you were in the shower... \n  \n  \n    221.90 \n    223.061 \n    ...your father was shot? \n  \n  \n    223.82 \n    224.901 \n    I guess. \n  \n  \n    226.22 \n    229.030 \n    Your father was shot\nwhile you were in the shower... \n  \n  \n    229.70 \n    232.783 \n    ...but you didn't\nhear the shot because... \n  \n  \n    236.62 \n    238.543 \n    ...because you were in the shower? \n  \n  \n    239.78 \n    243.580 \n    Yes.

Why is this relevant? \n  \n  \n    320.10 \n    323.229 \n    - I have a point. I promise.\n- Then make it. \n  \n  \n    324.02 \n    325.670 \n    Yes, ma'am. \n  \n  \n    326.42 \n    330.106 \n    Chutney, why were Tracy Marcinko's\ncurls ruined when she got hosed down? \n  \n  \n    331.86 \n    333.749 \n    - Because they got wet.\n- Exactly. \n  \n  \n    333.94 \n    336.511 \n    Because isn't it the first cardinal\nrule of perm maintenance \n  \n  \n    336.66 \n    338.867 \n    that you're forbidden\nto wet your hair for at least 24 hours \n  \n  \n    339.02 \n    340.988 \n    after getting a perm\nat the risk of deactivating \n  \n  \n    341.14 \n    345.270 \n    -the ammonium thioglycolate?\n- Yes... \n  \n  \n    345.42 \n    348.549 \n    And wouldn't somebody who's had,\nsay 30 perms before in their life \n  \n  \n    348.70 \n    350.702 \n    be well aware of this rule? \n  \n  \n    350.86 \n    353.750 \n    And if you weren't washing your hair,\nas I suspect you weren't, \n  \n  \n    353.90 \n    357.109 \n    because your curls are still intact,\nwouldn't you have heard the gunshot? \n  \n  \n    357.26 \n    359.911 \n    And if, in fact, you had heard the\ngunshot, Brooke Windham \n  \n  \n    360.06 \n    363.064 \n    wouldn't have had time to hide\nthe gun before you got downstairs, \n  \n  \n    363.26 \n    365.945 \n    which would mean that you would've\nhad to have found Mrs. Windham \n  \n  \n    366.14 \n    369.622 \n    with a gun in her hand to make\nyour story plausible. Isn't that right? \n  \n  \n    369.78 \n    372.147 \n    She's my age, did she tell you that? \n  \n  \n    372.30 \n    374.621 \n    How would you feel if your father\nmarried someone your age? \n  \n  \n    374.78 \n    377.306 \n    You, however, had time to hide the gun,\ndidn't you, Chutney? \n  \n  \n    377.46 \n    379.940 \n    - After you shot your father.\n- I didn't mean to shoot him! \n  \n  \n    380.10 \n    382.307 \n    I thought it was you\nwalking through the door! \n  \n  \n    382.46 \n    384.428 \n    (crowd exclaiming) \n  \n  \n    385.66 \n    388.982 \n    Order! Order! Order. \n  \n  \n    390.70 \n    392.941 \n    - Oh, my God.\n- Oh, my God. \n  \n  \n    393.10 \n    394.909 \n    Oh, my God. \n  \n  \n    396.66 \n    398.788 \n    Bailiff, take the witness into custody, \n  \n  \n    398.94 \n    402.069 \n    where she will be charged\nfor the murder of Heyworth Windham. \n  \n  \n    402.90 \n    405.506 \n    In the matter of\nThe State v.

    "text": "Continuous Ratings\nA total of 30 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    0.678 \n    0.455 \n    1.330 \n    0.374 \n  \n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.373 \n    0.327 \n    0.437 \n    0.206 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    0.763 \n    0.744 \n    0.782 \n    0.421 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Raters \n    Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    ICC(C,k) \n    0.937 \n    0.928 \n    0.945 \n    30 \n    Relative \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters. Values with higher posterior density are more probable."

    "text": "Continuous Ratings\nA total of 29 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    1.312 \n    0.864 \n    2.557 \n    0.584 \n  \n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.184 \n    0.142 \n    0.248 \n    0.082 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    0.750 \n    0.718 \n    0.787 \n    0.334 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Raters \n    Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    ICC(C,k) \n    0.878 \n    0.844 \n    0.906 \n    29 \n    Relative \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters. Values with higher posterior density are more probable."

    "text": "Continuous Ratings\nA total of 29 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    1.032 \n    0.693 \n    2.013 \n    0.569 \n  \n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.217 \n    0.185 \n    0.269 \n    0.120 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    0.566 \n    0.547 \n    0.584 \n    0.312 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Raters \n    Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    ICC(C,k) \n    0.919 \n    0.904 \n    0.933 \n    29 \n    Relative \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters. Values with higher posterior density are more probable."

    "text": "Film Information\n\n\nThe Parent Trap is a 1998 American romantic comedy film directed and co-written by Nancy Meyers, and produced and co-written by Charles Shyer. It is a remake of the 1961 film of the same name and an adaptation of Erich Kästner’s 1949 German novel Lisa and Lottie (Das doppelte Lottchen). Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters’ birth; Lindsay Lohan stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. David Swift wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on Lottie and Lisa. Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version.\n\n\nAll information in this section came from Wikipedia."

    "text": "Continuous Ratings\nA total of 33 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    0.613 \n    0.428 \n    1.177 \n    0.377 \n  \n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.329 \n    0.285 \n    0.378 \n    0.203 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    0.684 \n    0.668 \n    0.701 \n    0.421 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Raters \n    Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    ICC(C,k) \n    0.941 \n    0.932 \n    0.948 \n    33 \n    Relative \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters. Values with higher posterior density are more probable."

Smith’s son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner’s son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner’s nearly one-year struggle being homeless. The unusual spelling of the film’s title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended. The movie is set in San Francisco in 1981.\n\n\nAll information in this section came from Wikipedia."

    "text": "Continuous Ratings\nA total of 31 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    0.741 \n    0.528 \n    1.516 \n    0.376 \n  \n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.345 \n    0.295 \n    0.427 \n    0.175 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    0.885 \n    0.859 \n    0.914 \n    0.449 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Raters \n    Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    ICC(C,k) \n    0.925 \n    0.911 \n    0.937 \n    31 \n    Relative \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters. Values with higher posterior density are more probable."

    "text": "Continuous Ratings\nA total of 27 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    1.641 \n    1.072 \n    3.201 \n    0.507 \n  \n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.264 \n    0.220 \n    0.322 \n    0.082 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    1.329 \n    1.287 \n    1.371 \n    0.411 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Raters \n    Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    ICC(C,k) \n    0.845 \n    0.817 \n    0.868 \n    27 \n    Relative \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters.

Well, there is a connection \n  \n  \n    82.67 \n    84.57 \n    between one of the Zodiac attacks\nand that film. \n  \n  \n    85.54 \n    87.44 \n    You mean the symbol? \n  \n  \n    88.54 \n    90.31 \n    Hold on. \n  \n  \n    90.31 \n    94.45 \n    The Zodiac symbol on film.\nIt's on the countdown. \n  \n  \n    98.32 \n    100.22 \n    It's trimmed off each reel\nbefore it's shown, \n  \n  \n    101.02 \n    102.92 \n    but it always arrives with it. \n  \n  \n    103.66 \n    105.56 \n    Right there. \n  \n  \n    105.66 \n    109.37 \n    The first time I saw it in the papers,\nI thought about that. \n  \n  \n    110.20 \n    111.83 \n    We got a tip \n  \n  \n    111.83 \n    113.73 \n    that Rick left a film canister here\nthat he told you never to open. \n  \n  \n    115.90 \n    119.04 \n    A tip about a mysterious film canister? \n  \n  \n    119.87 \n    121.77 \n    Is it true? \n  \n  \n    123.14 \n    125.01 \n    Yes. \n  \n  \n    125.01 \n    126.91 \n    -Did you open it?\n-No. \n  \n  \n    127.41 \n    131.73 \n    -May I see it?\n-Rick took it back in 1972. \n  \n  \n    133.42 \n    135.32 \n    This tip is how you got it in your head\nthat Rick is the Zodiac? \n  \n  \n    138.29 \n    140.06 \n    That and the poster. \n  \n  \n    140.06 \n    141.96 \n    The poster? \n  \n  \n    143.36 \n    145.23 \n    The poster that Rick drew. \n  \n  \n    145.23 \n    147.13 \n    The handwriting is the closest\nthat we have ever come to a match. \n  \n  \n    148.54 \n    150.44 \n    -Rick didn't draw any posters.\n-No, he drew this one. \n  \n  \n    151.91 \n    155.38 \n    Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself. \n  \n  \n    156.74 \n    158.64 \n    That's my handwriting. \n  \n  \n    166.85 \n    168.75 \n    I won't take any more of your time. \n  \n  \n    169.82 \n    171.72 \n    Why don't I just go and find out\nwhen we played that film? \n  \n  \n    175.30 \n    176.86 \n    Oh, that's all right. \n  \n  \n    176.86 \n    180.31 \n    It's not a problem.\nThey're just down in the basement. \n  \n  \n    182.10 \n    185.05 \n    Not many people\nhave basements in California. \n  \n  \n    187.71 \n    189.61 \n    I do. \n  \n  \n    190.98 \n    192.98 \n    You coming, Mr. Graysmith? \n  \n  \n    204.26 \n    207.97 \n    The original studio one-sheets,\nI always kept for myself. \n  \n  \n    209.83 \n    211.73 \n    The cheapo knock-offs\nlike you brought today \n  \n  \n    212.47 \n    215.61 \n    I end up tossing into the back alley. \n  \n  \n    230.08 \n    231.98 \n    '69. \n  \n  \n    237.29 \n    238.62 \n    You live alone? \n  \n  \n    238.63 \n    240.53 \n    Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69. \n  \n  \n    244.50 \n    246.98 \n    So, that would be about \n  \n  \n    247.87 \n    251.18 \n    nine weeks before\nthe first Zodiac letter, correct? \n  \n  \n    254.07 \n    255.97 \n    Yeah. \n  \n  \n    259.65 \n    263.96 \n    Do you think he saw the film\nin our theater and was inspired? \n  \n  \n    270.02 \n    272.94 \n    Are you sure\nthere's nobody else in the house? \n  \n  \n    274.53 \n    277.24 \n    Would you like\nto go upstairs and check? \n  \n  \n    277.93 \n    279.83 \n    No. \n  \n  \n    282.07 \n    284.64 \n    Thank you.

    "text": "Continuous Ratings\nA total of 29 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nTime Series\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\n\n\n\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Component \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Rater \n    Variance \n    0.825 \n    0.571 \n    1.715 \n    0.335 \n  \n  \n    Timepoint \n    Variance \n    0.977 \n    0.845 \n    1.172 \n    0.397 \n  \n  \n    Residual \n    Variance \n    0.662 \n    0.644 \n    0.683 \n    0.269 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here is the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Term \n    Estimate \n    Lower \n    Upper \n    Raters \n    Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    ICC(C,k) \n    0.978 \n    0.974 \n    0.981 \n    29 \n    Relative \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters. Values with higher posterior density are more probable."
