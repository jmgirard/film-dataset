The table below provides the number of raters and duration per clip as well as a summary of the valence ratings distribution across raters (i.e., mean, standard deviation, and quartiles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Abbrev \n    Raters \n    Mean \n    SD \n    p0 \n    p25 \n    p50 \n    p75 \n    p100 \n  \n \n\n  \n    Akeelah \n    33 \n    1.66 \n    1.52 \n    -2.03 \n    0.40 \n    1.60 \n    2.81 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    BealeStreet \n    30 \n    0.57 \n    1.35 \n    -4.00 \n    -0.20 \n    0.55 \n    1.42 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    CatchMe \n    36 \n    0.33 \n    1.45 \n    -3.20 \n    -0.80 \n    0.44 \n    1.40 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    DaysOfSummer \n    31 \n    0.38 \n    1.25 \n    -3.40 \n    -0.40 \n    0.35 \n    1.20 \n    3.60 \n  \n  \n    Fences \n    30 \n    -2.09 \n    1.39 \n    -4.00 \n    -3.22 \n    -2.28 \n    -1.02 \n    2.00 \n  \n  \n    ForrestGump \n    32 \n    -0.44 \n    1.61 \n    -4.00 \n    -1.60 \n    -0.60 \n    0.81 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    GoodWillHunting \n    29 \n    0.12 \n    1.50 \n    -4.00 \n    -0.75 \n    0.23 \n    1.01 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    GreenMile \n    30 \n    -2.71 \n    1.42 \n    -4.00 \n    -4.00 \n    -3.19 \n    -2.14 \n    3.00 \n  \n  \n    Happyness \n    32 \n    1.50 \n    1.52 \n    -2.91 \n    0.43 \n    1.52 \n    2.72 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    KingsSpeech \n    29 \n    0.77 \n    1.75 \n    -4.00 \n    -0.60 \n    0.99 \n    2.09 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    LadyBird \n    29 \n    0.23 \n    1.44 \n    -4.00 \n    -0.80 \n    0.00 \n    1.12 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    LegallyBlonde \n    30 \n    1.33 \n    1.35 \n    -3.10 \n    0.46 \n    1.38 \n    2.25 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    LittleMissSunshine \n    29 \n    -0.17 \n    1.50 \n    -4.00 \n    -1.11 \n    -0.24 \n    0.77 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    MarriageStory \n    29 \n    -1.97 \n    1.76 \n    -4.00 \n    -3.36 \n    -2.35 \n    -1.00 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    Miracle \n    30 \n    1.16 \n    1.57 \n    -2.15 \n    0.00 \n    1.03 \n    2.55 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    Moonlight \n    30 \n    1.41 \n    1.27 \n    -1.80 \n    0.40 \n    1.20 \n    2.40 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    NoCountry \n    29 \n    -1.08 \n    1.35 \n    -4.00 \n    -2.04 \n    -1.17 \n    -0.33 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    ParentTrap \n    33 \n    2.06 \n    1.28 \n    -2.41 \n    1.20 \n    2.20 \n    3.00 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    PulpFiction \n    32 \n    0.44 \n    1.38 \n    -2.80 \n    -0.60 \n    0.40 \n    1.36 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    Silence \n    31 \n    -1.14 \n    1.42 \n    -4.00 \n    -2.16 \n    -1.04 \n    -0.02 \n    3.20 \n  \n  \n    SocialNetwork \n    27 \n    -0.33 \n    1.79 \n    -4.00 \n    -1.70 \n    -0.40 \n    1.13 \n    4.00 \n  \n  \n    Zodiac \n    29 \n    -0.75 \n    1.58 \n    -4.00 \n    -1.96 \n    -0.60 \n    0.20 \n    3.80 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nratings |> \n  mutate(Rater = fct_reorder(.f = factor(Rater), .x = Rating, na.rm = TRUE)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Rating, y = Rater)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nExamine distribution of ratings per video (across seconds and raters)"
